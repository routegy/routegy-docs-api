# Routegy Docs (API)

Public documentation for the [Routegy API](https://github.com/routegy/routegy-api) at <https://api.docs.routegy.com>.

## tl;dr

This project converts a [swagger (OpenApi 2.0) spec file](source/openapi/spec.json) into a [Slate markdown document](source/index.html.md) which is converted into html.

## Quick Start

1) Convert the swagger config into Slate markdown:

```
make build-swagger
```

2) Host the slate docs locally:

```
make serve
```

3) Build docs into static site:

```
make build
```
